      <img src="/tool_config.png" style="width: 300px; float: right;" alt=""/>
      <p>LTI tool configuration in Canvas can happen on the course or account.
      Click the "Settings" link in the left sidebar of the course or account
      where you want to add the tool. Click the "External Tools" tab and click
      "Add External Tool".
      </p>
      <p>Enter the name, consumer key and shared secret for the
      tool (for these demo tools you can put any key and secret that you like).
      For "configuration type" select "By URL" and paste in the full URL of the
      link configuration (copy the URL from one of the links below).
      </p>
      <p>After the tool is saved you should see it appear as configured in the
      course our account content.</p>
      <h2>Default Configurations</h2>
      <p>These are basic XML configurations for LTI tools with extensions. You
      can copy and paste these URLs as standard configuration, or try modifying
      the configuration XML to set up more advanced configurations. More information
      on tool configuration is availabe in the <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/tools_intro.html">Canvas API docs</a></p>

            course navigation. This link is available to anyone with access to 
            the course. If it's configured at the account level, the link will
            be added to all courses within that account.

          <div>
            This example showcases the LTI Outcomes functionality which is
            part of LTI 1.1. After this tool is configured, create a new assignment
            with type "External Tool". Select the configured tool and then
            access the assignment as a student to test its functionality.

          <div>
            <img src="/editor_button_example.png" alt=""/>
            This shows adding an editor button to the rich editor
            in course/group content. Clicking the new fish icon will pop up a dialog
            with pictures of fish. Clicking any of the fish will insert that
            image into the rich content pane. If the tool is configured at the account
            level, then the button will appear for any courses/groups within 
            that account.

            This shows adding an editor button to the rich editor
            in course/group content. Clicking the new kitten icon will pop up a dialog
            that uses placekitten.com to generate an image of a kitten set
            to the user's specified dimensions. If the tool is configured at the account
            level, then the button will appear for any courses/groups within 
            that account.

            <img src="/resource_selection_example.png" alt=""/>
            This tool allows the user to pick and insert custom content as link
            in course modules. When inserting content into a module, if the user
            picks "External Tools" they'll see the configured tool with a "find"
            icon. Clicking the tool will bring up a new dialog where the user
            can pick/build content (in this case creating a page that shows an
            image of a fish with a user-specified name for the fish) 
            to be inserted as a page or resource within
            the current module. If the tool is configured at the account level,
            then it will be available for any courses within that account.

          <div>
            This example shows configuring a tool to serve multiple purposes at
            the same time. In this case, a single tool can add both a fish 
            icon to the rich editor, and the ability to add named fish pages to
            course modules.

            This is a real-world example that allows users to insert rich,
            interactive graphs into course content. Users can type in arbitrary
            equations (similar to the Canvas equation editor) and see them
            rendered in the graph. They can then position the graph and click
            to insert it into the page.

            as flash cards, practice quizzes, or matching games directly
